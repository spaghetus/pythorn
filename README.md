# pythorn

A program/dialect that makes python better and worse

To write pythorn, just write semi-valid python, and put 'pass' at the end of every indented block. Now, you can screw up the indentation as much as you like, and it will (probably) generate sane python.

Also (probably) works for GDScript and other indent-sensitive languages where blocks begin with ':' and can end with 'pass'.
